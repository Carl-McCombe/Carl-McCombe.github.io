# Who am I?

Hi, my name is Carl and I am a PhD student at The Australian National University. I am passionate about molecular biology, and am thrilled to be able to spend my days conducting research into the functions of proteins involved in plant-microbe interactions. I have had the opportunity to contribute to several publications in my field, and I am excited to continue this work in the future. If you'd like to learn more about my research, please check out my [publications](publications.md) page. 

In my spare time, I enjoy running, bouldering, occassionally making 3D art in [Blender](blender_renders.md) and coding in [Python](code.md), and chilling out with the two cutest [rabbits](buns.md).

Thank you for visiting my website!
