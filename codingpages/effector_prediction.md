title: Effector Prediction with Simple Machine Learning
---

The aim of this notebook was to introduce myself to some very basic machine learning, it was not to create a highly accurate effector prediction program. If you're looking for accurate effector prediction, please go to [EffectorP](https://effectorp.csiro.au/).

Effectors are small proteins secreted by plant pathogens that aim to promote growth of the pathogen, often by interfering with the host immune response.
