# Plant Structural Immunology

I am completing my PhD in the [Williams Lab](https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/groups/williams-group-plant-structural-immunology) at The Australian National University. We are a 'Plant Structural Immunology' group, meaning that our research centres around understanding plant diseases and immunity by determining the 3-D structures of proteins involved in pathogenesis. As protein structure is a key determinant of protein function, we can use the structures to work out how the protein functions to prevent or promote disease. 

# Protein Crystals 

In order to determine the structure of proteins we use a method called 'X-ray crystallography'. This requires the protein to first be purified and then crystallised. Below are some of the more aesthetic protein crystals that I have produced during my PhD.

#Protein Structures 

I'll update this section with my pdb files and images of my protein structures once I have uploaded them to the protein data bank.
