title: Academic Website Tutorial
---

# Preface
I am not an expert in website development or design. The only experience I have is on my own site and I have no formal education in IT. If you want a comprehensive tutorial on making a website this is not it, I would recommend checking out other available resources like ... and ...
However, I am a PhD student and believe I understand how time-limited academics/researchers are. Therefore this tutorial is made for those of you who would benefit from an academic website but may not have the time to read long tutorials that cover lots of information that you don't need for a simple academic site. 
To make this especially quick and easy (and free!) the website will be built using GitHub Pages.
# Aim
This tutorial will take approximately 45 minutes to complete and by the end of it you will have your own academic site and the knowledge to easily update the site whenever you wish. 
# Methods 
1. Make a GitHub account if you don't already have one, sign up here [GitHub](https://github.com). Your username will be the name of the website (e.g. my username is Carl-McCombe and therefore this site is https://carl-mccombe.github.io), so choose your username carefully. 
2. Log into GitHub, navigate to the repositories tab.
