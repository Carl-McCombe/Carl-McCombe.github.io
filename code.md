In 2020 I decided to learn basic programming and data visualisation using Python by following YouTube tutorials and completing small projects. 
You can check out the various programs/plots I have made by clicking the links below (many of these pages are a work in progress, some links may not be functional yet).


## Programs

- [Adding or removing codon spaces from nucleic acid sequences](/codingpages/codon_spaces.md)
- [Automating RNA-seq read mapping and quantification using Salmon](/codingpages/RNA_seq.md)
- [Analysing large protein datasets to identify Nudix hydrolases](/codingpages/nudix.md)
- [Predicting effectors with basic machine learning](/codingpages/effector_prediction.md)
- [Determing codon usage stats from large cDNA sequence datasets](/codingpages/codon_usage.md)
- [Searching for sequence-motifs in gene promoters](/codingpages/promoters.md)
- [Analysing the relative proportion of RNA-Seq reads mapping to the 5' and 3' ends of transcripts](/codingpages/read_locations.md)

## Plots

- [Displaying size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering data](/codingpages/MALS.md)
- [Displaying multiple size-exclusion chromatograms on a single plot with highlighted regions](/codingpages/SEC.md)
- [A simple line plot using a fill-between function to demostrate error bars, useful for assays with many measurements taken over a time-course](/codingpages/fillbetween.md) 
- [Creating multiple barchats simultaneously to display the average reads for RNA-Seq treatments for multiple transcripts](/codingpages/barchats_RNA.md)
