# Blender3D Art

Still only just starting to scratch the surface of what Blender is capable of. Most of my renders are science-related (love seeing my favourite proteins in all their glory), I also attempt to make a cover image for every publication I'm involved in. 

## Single Image Renders

Render 1: An agar plate with E. coli colonies, one of my first renders assisted by a [Luminous Lab](https://www.youtube.com/c/LuminousLab) tutorial.

## Cover Images 

Cover 1: This cover image is inspired by a [publication](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17516) on Tox3, a small protein secreted by a wheat pathogen. This protein causes plant cell-death in susceptible wheat varieties leading to enhanced disease and yield loss. [Megan Outram](https://orcid.org/
0000-0003-4510-3575) determined the structure of Tox3 and completed most of the work described in the paper.
