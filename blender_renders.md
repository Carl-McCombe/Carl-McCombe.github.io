## Single Image Renders

Render 1: An agar plate with E. coli colonies, one of my first blender renders assisted by a [Luminous Lab](https://www.youtube.com/c/LuminousLab) tutorial.

## Cover Images 

Cover 1: This cover image is inspired by a [publication](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17516) on Tox3, a small protein secreted by a wheat pathogen. This protein causes plant cell-death in susceptible wheat varieties leading to enhanced disease and yield loss. [Megan Outram](https://orcid.org/
0000-0003-4510-3575) determined the structure of Tox3 and completed most of the work described in the paper.

Cover 2: At the start of 2022 I wrote a [review](https://portlandpress.com/essaysbiochem/article/66/5/581/231321/Molecular-plant-immunity-against-biotrophic) on plant immunity against biotrophic, hemibiotrophic, and necrotrophic fungi. For the review I designed and produced a cover image that showcases a couple of groundbreaking structures of plant immunity receptors.
