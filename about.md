# Who am I?

I am a PhD student at The Australian National University conducting research on the proteins that are secreted by pathogenic fungi during plant infection. I spend most of my time purifying these fungal proteins, and conduct experiments to work out how they function. For more information on the research that I have contributed to, check out my [publications](publications.md) page.

Outside of the lab I spend my time running, bouldering, occassionally making 3D art in [Blender](blender_renders.md) and coding in [Python](code.md), and chilling out with the two cutest [rabbits](buns.md).
