# Who am I?

I am a PhD student at The Australian National University studying the proteins that fungi use to infect plants. I spend most of my time purifying these fungal proteins, and conduct experiments to work out how they function. For my information on my research check out my [publications](publications.md).

Outside of the lab I spend my time bouldering, ice skating, making 3D art in [Blender](blender_renders.md), and chilling out with my girlfriend and [rabbits](buns.md).

For my information on my past and present work check out my [ORICID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9347-8879), [publons](https://publons.com/researcher/4843499/carl-mccombe/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Carl_McCombe).
