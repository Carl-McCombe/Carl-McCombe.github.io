In 2020 I decided to learn basic programming and data visualisation using Python by following YouTube tutorials and completing small projects. 
You can check out some of the various programs/plots I have made by clicking the links below. Hoping to update this page with more examples soon!


## Programs

- [Adding or removing codon spaces from nucleic acid sequences](/codingpages/codon_spaces.md)
- [Analysing large protein datasets to identify Nudix hydrolases](/codingpages/nudix.md)
- [Determing codon usage stats from large cDNA sequence datasets](/codingpages/codon_usage.md)

## Plots

- [Displaying size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering data](/codingpages/MALS.md)
